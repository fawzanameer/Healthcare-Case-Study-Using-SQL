    <h1>SQL Data Analysis Project</h1>

    <p>Hello everyone, I'm Fawzan.</p>

    <p>This project is the culmination of my studies for a data analytics certificate at Ivy Pro School. The aim was to
        utilize SQL for analyzing publicly available data.</p>

    <h2>Data Source</h2>

    <p>The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle. You can access the dataset <a href="www.test.com">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>The project revolves around answering several key questions using SQL queries:</p>

    <h3>Questions Explored</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Physicians & Patients Count by Hospitals</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Patient Count by City</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Patient Count by Age Bins & Gender</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Insurance Payer Distribution</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Department-wise Physicians Count in Each Hospital</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Top 5 Most Consulted Departments by Gender</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Bottom 5 Most Consulted Departments by Gender</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Monthly Consultation Count (Visits)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Most Common Diagnosis Code in December & January</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Rare Diagnosis Occurrences</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Top 10 Most Used and Least Used Claim Codes</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Feel free to explore the SQL queries in the respective files in this repository to delve into the insights
        obtained from this analysis.</p>
