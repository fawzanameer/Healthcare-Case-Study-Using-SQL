# SQL Data Analysis Project

Hello everyone, I'm Fawzan.
This project is the culmination of my studies for a data analytics certificate at Ivy Pro School. The aim was to utilize SQL for analyzing publicly available data.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle. You can access the dataset from this link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomaslui/healthcare-dataset

## Project Overview
The project revolves around answering several key questions using SQL queries:

## Questions Explored
1. Physicians & Patients Count by Hospitals
2. Patient Count by City
3. Patient Count by Age Bins & Gender
4. Insurance Payer Distribution
5. Department-wise Physicians Count in Each Hospital
6. Top 5 Most Consulted Departments by Gender
7. Bottom 5 Most Consulted Departments by Gender
8. Monthly Consultation Count (Visits)
9. Most Common Diagnosis Code in December & January
10. Rare Diagnosis Occurrences
11. Top 10 Most Used and Least Used Claim Codes
