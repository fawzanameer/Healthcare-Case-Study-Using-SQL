# SQL Data Analysis Project

Hello everyone, I'm Fawzan.
This project is the culmination of my studies for a data analytics certificate at Ivy Pro School. The aim was to utilize SQL for analyzing publicly available data.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle. You can access the dataset from this link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomaslui/healthcare-dataset
